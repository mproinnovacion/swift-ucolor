# UColor

## Motivation

This library was built with the purpose of converting SwiftUI colors more easily. By doing
so, the main project does not need to add extra fuzzy code that makes it heavier and less
readable. Several problems arise when comparing UIColor and NSColor as they are not structs.
Some cases include difficulty accessing color variables due to not being able to serialize 
them. To avoid that, this library uses simple models that allow easy transformations of 
functionalities.
